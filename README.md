<h3>Actually, this application is made for programmers. You can store your word translations which you don't know. If you are going to take an exam or prepare for one, you will need this app. When you have learnt a new word, add it to the app and save :)</h3>
<h3>Eclipse Mars and MySQL 5.7 used for making this app. Just import to your Eclipse Workspace, create a DB and start to use it.</h3>
<h3>DB properties you can change in <u>MySQLConnector.java</u> file!</h3>
